**bud** is designed to be a CLI but it is possible to use it as a node API directly. This makes it easier to:

- Use **bud** as part of an existing asset pipeline
- Use **bud** to generate a configuration to be consumed by **webpack** directly
- Modify the **bud** object before running a build

## Using Bud with Node

The easiest way to get going is calling the **factory** helper exported from **@roots/bud**.

<Tabs
  groupId="lang"
  defaultValue="ts"
  values={[
    {label: 'Javascript', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="js">

```js title='config/build.js'
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory()
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ts">

```ts title='config/build.ts'
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'
import type {Framework} from '@roots/bud'

const app: Framework = factory()
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You may wish to override **bud** services, its base configuration, or programatically set
the compiler mode to `production` or `development`. These can all be specified with optional factory config properties.

You may also wish to import the `config` and `services` objects from `@roots/bud` to merge your overrides with
the defaults. This way, you don't have to reimplement the entire framework.

<Tabs
  groupId="lang"
  defaultValue="ts"
  values={[
    {label: 'Javascript', value: 'js'},
    {label: 'TypeScript', value: 'ts'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="js">

```js title='config/build.js'
import {config, factory, services} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory({
  name: 'bud'
  mode: 'production'
  config: {
    ...config,
    // config overrides
  },
  services: {
    ...services,
    // service overrides
  }
})
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ts">

```js title='config/build.ts'
import {config, factory, services} from '@roots/bud'
import type {Framework} from '@roots/bud'

const app: Framework = factory({
  name: 'bud'
  mode: 'production'
  config: {
    ...config,
    // config overrides
  },
  services: {
    ...services,
    // service overrides
  }
})
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The return value of **factory** is an instance of **Bud**, just as it is passed to the callback function exported by `bud.config.js`.
Configuration from that point on should be identical, with the exception of you needing to run the build and/or development server.

## Running a build from Node

Once configured, simply call **bud.run** to run the build. In `development` the server will be instantiated for you.

```js
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory()

app.entry('app', 'app.js').run()
```

## Exporting a webpack config

It's possible to utilize **bud** to create a config to be used with **webpack** directly should you not want to use
the **bud** CLI.

This is done by exporting the **bud.build.config** accessor from a file called `webpack.config.js`.

```js title='webpack.config.js'
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory()
const config = app.entry('app', 'app.js').build.config

export default config
```

Now, you can use the webpack cli as per their documentation to run your build while still taking advantage of all
the quality of life improvements afforded by **bud**.
