Bud is a frontend build tooling framework combining the best parts of Symfony Encore and Laravel Mix.

It essentially wraps Webpack and some associated tools and provides a friendly, chainable api 
and some battle-tested prefabs to help you stay focused on your application code.

## Installation

See [installation instructions](/guides/installation).

## Getting started

If you don't know a lot about Webpack, check out the [Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started/intro). 
It was written with you in mind specifically.

## Working with the CLI

Check out the [bud cli guide](/guides/bud-cli/introduction) for usage instructions.

## Advanced topics

- [Configuring with TypeScript](/guides/advanced/configuration/typescript)
- [Configuring with yml or json](/guides/advanced/configuration/static)
- [Running multiple compilers](/guides/advanced/multi-compiler)
- [Using as a node library](/guides/advanced/node)

## Configuration function reference

Common `bud.config.js` functions are all detailed [in their own docs](/docs/index). It is also a great resource to skim if you're 
trying to figure out what all **bud** can do.

## Extensions repository

In bud most features are opt-in and provided via installable extensions. You may be interested in scoping out 
the [list of extensions and their documented uses](/extensions/index).

## Framework API

Detailed documentation and typings are available in [the Framework API documentation](/api/api). 

It is low-level documentation generated with typedoc from Bud's annotated source but provides the 
clearest picture of how **bud** is architected.
