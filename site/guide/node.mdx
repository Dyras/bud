**bud** is designed to be a CLI but it is possible to use it as a node API directly. This makes it easier to: 

- Use **bud** as part of an existing pipeline like gulp
- Use **bud** to generate a configuration to be consumed by **webpack** directly
- Modify **bud** before running a build.

## Using the bud factory

```js
import {factory} from '@roots/bud'

const app = factory()

app.tap(app => {
  // configure as needed
})
```
