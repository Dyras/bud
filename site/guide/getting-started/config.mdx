# Configuring our build

So far we've been working without a configuration file which is easy but not very flexible. In this guide we'll add a config file to our build so that we have a little more control.

## Create bud.config.js

Create a file named **bud.config.js** file in the project root. This file exports a single function that will tell **bud** to serve our js using bud's built-in html template.

```js title='bud.config.js'
module.exports = bud => bud.template()
```

:::info bud.config.js isn't the only way

You can also configure your project with json or yml. We won't be covering that now but it is an option you might want to look into later.

:::

With our config file in place, start the development server.

```shell
yarn bud dev
```

Your site is now available to view in browser at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Open **src/index.js** and make some edits: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
