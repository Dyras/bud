# Running our build

:::success

Nope, you didn't miss a step. No configuration is needed as long you have something at **src/index.js**.

:::

<Tabs
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    {label: 'yarn', value: 'yarn'},
    {label: 'npm', value: 'npm'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

    yarn bud build

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

    npm run bud build

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

You should see your built assets in **dist** (along with a file called **manifest.json**).

```shell {2-4} title='$ tree -I node_modules'
  ├── package.json
  ├── dist
  │   ├── main.js
  |   ├── main.css
  │   └── manifest.json
  └── src
      ├── index.js
      └── index.css
```

## Next steps

For anything beyond the simplest projects, you'll likely need to provide some configuration, which [we'll do in the next step](/guide/getting-started/config).
