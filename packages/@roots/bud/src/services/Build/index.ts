 * üìù For typescript users who wish to maintain typing accuracy while adding support for
 * various loaders, items and rules:
 *
 * - {@link loaders} should be declared by augmenting the {@link Framework.Loaders} interface
 * - {@link items} should be declared by augmenting the {@link Framework.Items} interface
 * - {@link rules} should be declared by augmenting the {@link Framework.Rules} interface
 *
 * üëÄ A lot of `@roots/bud` extensions do this as well, if you are looking for an example of
 * how to add to an external interface definition
