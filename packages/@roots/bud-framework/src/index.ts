 * @remarks
 * The {@link @roots/bud-framework#} package defines the
 * central abstract {@link Framework} class and provides
 * interfaces for the Framework's essential {@link Service}
 * classes.
 *
 * {@link Framework} is to be extended by a class providing implementations
 * for the service interfaces exported herein.
